# Unambiguous Thin Register Abstraction (UTRA)

## Motivation

UTRA is a register abstraction for accessing hardware resources. It tries to be:

* Unambiguous -- the access rules should be concise and unambiguous to a systems programmer with a C background
* Thin -- it should hide constants, but not bury them so they become difficult to verify

Here is an example of an ambiguous style of register access, from a
PAC generated using [svd2rust](https://crates.io/crates/svd2rust):

```
    // this seems clear -- as long as all the bit fields are specified
    // (they actually aren't, so some non-obvious things are happening)
    p.POWER.power.write(|w| 
       w.discharge().bit(true)
        .soc_on().bit(false)
        .kbddrive().bit(true)
        .kbdscan().bits(3)
      );

    // what should this do?
    // 1. just set the discharge bit to true and everything else to zero?
    // 2. read the register first, change only the discharge bit to true, leaving the rest unchanged?
    p.POWER.power.write(|w| 
       w.discharge().bit(true)
      );
      
    // answer: it does (1). You need to use the `modify()` function to have (2) happen.

```

While the closure-chaining is clever syntax, it's also ambiguous.
First, does the chaining imply an order of writes happening in
sequence, or do they all happen at once? The answer depends on Rust's
optimizer, which is very good and one can expect the behavior to be
the latter, but it is still write-ordering behavior that depends upon
the outcome of an optimizer and not a linguistic guarantee. Second,
the term `write` itself is ambiguous when it comes to bitfields: do we
write just the bitfield, or do we write the entire register, assuming
the rest of the contents are zero? These types of ambiguity make it
hard to audit code, especially for experts in systems programming
who are not also experts in Rust.

The primary trade-off for achieving unambiguity and thinness is less
type checking and type hardening, because we are not fully taking
advantage of the advanced syntax features of Rust. 

That being said, a certain degree of deliberate malleability in the
register abstraction is desired to assist with security-oriented
audits: for a security audit, it is often just as important to ask
what the undefined bits do, as it is to check the settings of the
defined bits. Malleabilty allows an auditor to quickly create targeted
tests that exercise undefined bits. Existing Rust-based access crates
create strict types that eliminate the class of errors where constants
defined for one register are used in an incorrect type of register,
but they also make it very hard to modify in an ad-hoc manner.

## API

This crate is designed to serve as an alternative to `svd2rust`. It generates
a crate which consists of:

1. A library which is used to perform register accesses
2. A "header file" (library) that is auto-generated from a given `soc.svd` and `csr.csv` file

The library provides the a function template for `CSR` that provides the following
methods:

* `.r(reg: Register) -> T` - read the entire contents of a CSR
* `.rf(field: Field) -> T` - read a CSR and return only the masked and shifted value of a sub-field
* `.wo(reg: Register, value:T)` - write `value` into a register, replacing its entire contents
* `.wof(field: Field, value:T)` - write `value` into a field of a register, zeroizing all the other fields and replacing its entire contents
* `.rmwf(field: Field, value:T)` - read-modify-write a register, replacing just the contents of `field` while leaving the other fields intact

`Register` and `Field` are generated by the library; `Field` refers to
the `Register` to which it belongs, and thus it is not necessary to
specify it explicitly. Furthermore, the base address of the `CSR` is
bound when the object is created, which allows the crate to work both
with physical and virtual addresses by replacing the base address with
the desired value depending upon the active addressing mode.

In addition to the `CSR` function template, convenience constants for
the CSR base, as well as any memory bases and interrupts, are also
generated by this crate.

This set of API calls supports the most common set of use cases, which
is reading, writing, and updating single fields of a register, or
entire registers all at once.

The API does not natively support setting two fields
simultaneously. This is because there can be nuances to this that
depend upon the hardware implementation, such as bit fields that are
self-resetting, registers that self-clear on read, or registers that
have other automatic and implicit side effects.

Users that require multiple bit fields to be set simultaneously must
explicitly read the CSR value, bind it to a temporary variable, mask
out the fields they want to replace, and combine in the values before
writing it back to the CSR.

To aid with this, the following helper functions are also available:

* `zf(field:Field, value:T) -> T` - zeroize field. Take bits corresponding to `field` and set it to zero in `value`, leaving other bits unchanged
* `ms(field:Field, value:T) -> T` - mask and shift. Take value, mask it to the field width, and then shift to its final position.

The idea here is that the `.r(register)` method is used to read the
entire register; then successive `.zf(field, value)` calls are made to
clear the fields prior to setting. Field values are OR'd with the
result of `.ms(field, value)` to create the final composite register
value.  Finally, `.wo(value)` is used to overwrite the entire
register with the final composite register value.

The `.ms(field,value)` can also be used to synthesize initial register
values that need to be committed all at once to a hardware register,
before a `.wo(value)` call.
